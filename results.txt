Description of the output:

	The K-Means Clustering algorithm returns two clusters, one that is
	comprised of presumably "good" colleges, and another that is 
	presumably "bad" colleges. 

	Using a list of relevant Good College Names, 
	and a list of relevant Bad College Names, the Evaluator class
	calculates the precision, recall, f-Score, and MAP-Score 
	for the clusters that the KMeans Class returned. 


	The results for the algorithms' clustering are listed below:

	Evaluating Bad Colleges
	Precision: 0.9166666666666666
	Recall: 0.88
	F-Score: 0.8979591836734694
	MAP-Score: 0.8091917211951537


	Evaluating Good Colleges
	Precision: 0.9259259259259259
	Recall: 0.9615384615384616
	F-Score: 0.9433962264150944
	MAP-Score: 0.9168205797870859


Significance of the output:

	Over multiple runs of our program, we get a few different versions of the
	two final clusters, only differing by one element.
 
	Our results show that our K-Means clustering algorithm had higher a precision,
	recall, f-score, and MAP-score when evaluating the colleges labeled "good" than
	the colleges labeled "bad". While slightly less accurate, the algorithm still
	performed well when evaluating the "bad" colleges.

	"Good" Colleges:
	Precision = 93%, Recall: 96%, F-Score: 94%, MAP-Score: 92%.

	"Bad" Colleges:
	Precision = 92%, Recall: 88%, F-Score: 89%, and a MAP-Score: 81%.

	Overall the K-Means clustering was an effective method for classifying
	our input data into two categories, "good" and "bad". 

	These results are particularly interesting because by using a mix of colleges from 
	all over the United States we clustered the colleges into two separate groups. As we
	had predicted, the algorithm clustered the colleges into "good" and "bad" colleges.
	We had added Cal Poly into the data because we were interested to see what group the
	algorithm would cluster Cal Poly into. In every run of the program, Cal Poly was
	clustered along with prestigous schools such as Yale, Harvard, UCLA, and Stanford. 
	It was interesting to see how accuratley the algorithm could group the colleges and
	make predictions on unseen data points.

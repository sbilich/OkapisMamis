Algorithm Used: K-Means Clustering

Description: This algorithm takes in our college data and clusters the data entries
		into two separate clusters.

The K-means clustering algorithm partitions the inputted data 
into k clusters by doing the following:

1) Randomly selects k data points (seeds) to be the initial centroids, cluster centers
2) Assign each data point to the nearest centroid 
3) Find the distance between each data point to each centroids
   using the Euclidean distance formula
4) Re-compute the centroids using the current cluster memberships
5) If a convergence criterion* is not met, go back to 2)

  * In our implementation, the convergence criterion is if the 
    cluster memberships remain the same from one iteration to the next

     Advantages to using K-means Clustering
	- Easy to implement
	- O(t*k*n), n is the number of data points, k is the number of 
	  clusters, and t is the number of iterations
	- K-means is considered a linear algorithm, since both k and t are small

     Weaknesses of K-means
	- Can only use k-means if the mean is defined
	- The user only needs to specify k
	- The algorithm is sensitive to outliers
